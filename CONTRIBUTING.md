Welcome to the Write My Idea community!

Thank you very much for taking the time to contribute to our app! All feedback is valued.
That said, there are some basic guidelines we would like you to follow:

- Make sure all feedback (good or bad) is constructive. Don't just say "it's bad" - that doesn't help us make it better! Give us details of what's wrong and how we can make it better.
- Include specific details. This means you should tell us what you did that caused the problem. If possible, include screenshots or an error log.
- Most importantly, respect everyone's opinions and views. Avoid using 'but', and try 'and' or 'maybe'!
