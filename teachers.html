		<p><em>Write My Idea!</em> is a platform for students to write their stories, without being restrained by an inability to write. It supports voice input, and allows kids to express their ideas in a simple way.<br>Each story comprises of 5 "core ideas". Each idea is one part of the story (for example: "I went to the beach." is one idea).</p>
		<h2 id="faq">Frequently Asked Questions</h2>
		<h3>The <i class="fas fa-microphone"></i> icon isn't showing up on the keyboard.</h3>
		<p>The microphone icon might not show up if you haven't enabled Dictation on your device. Enter your device's settings app, and search for "<em>dictation</em>" or "<em>speech</em>" and make sure it's enabled.</p>
		<h3>Can students put in less than 5 ideas?</h3>
		<p>Not yet. Currently, the requirement is 5, but this may change later.</p>
		<h3>Why is the ideas box red?</h3>
		<p>The idea box turns red when a bad word has been entered. Tap <i class="fas fa-eraser"></i> to clear the box, and try again.</p>
		<h3>How do I print the worksheets?</h3>
		<p><strong>On iOS:</strong> tap the Share icon (<i class="fas fa-share-square"></i>), scroll across on the third row, and tap Print.<br><strong>On Android:</strong> look for a Share button/icon and tap it. Find the Print option, and tap it.<br><strong>On Mac:</strong> press &#8984;+P.<br><strong>On Windows/Linux:</strong> press Ctrl+P.</p>
		<h3>Why isn't Dictation recognising my words?</h3>
		<p>Your dictation services might not pick up the words you say properly for one of two reasons:<ol>
				<li><strong>New device</strong> - If you're using a new device, the speech recognition service on it may not have adjusted to your particular voice yet.</li>
				<li><strong>Speech settings</strong> - Check your speech settings. It may be that your device is set to be trained to a certain accent or language. Change it to suit you and try again.</li>
			</ol>
